# Normalization and Regularization

Objective is to implement normalization (Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, Group Normalization) techniques on MNIST dataset.

## Experiments and Model performance

##### Group Normalization:
1. Training Accuracy=97.41
2. Testing Accuarcy=99.24
3. Loss=0.0275

##### Layer Normalization:
1. Training Accuracy=97.50
2. Testing Accuarcy=99.24
3. Loss=0.0265

##### Batch Normalization:
1. Training Accuracy=97.12
2. Testing Accuarcy=99.21
3. Loss=0.0266
